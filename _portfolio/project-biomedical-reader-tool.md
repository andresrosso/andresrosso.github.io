## Key Features

### 1. **Graph-Based Relationship Extraction**
- Automatically identifies and visualizes relationships between critical entities such as diseases, treatments, patient populations, and outcomes.
- Provides an interactive graph representation that allows users to explore key connections within the paper.
- Enables filtering of entities based on relevance or type (e.g., diseases, drugs, genes).

### 2. **Intelligent Question Answering**
- Allows users to ask detailed, paper-specific questions in natural language.
- Returns precise answers, supported by evidence from the text.
- Includes multi-turn conversations, enabling users to refine queries or dive deeper into specific topics.

### 3. **Concept Definitions**
- Automatically extracts and defines key biomedical terms and concepts from the paper.
- Provides concise, context-aware explanations for complex terms.
- Includes integration with external biomedical databases (e.g., PubMed, MeSH) for comprehensive definitions.

### 4. **Advanced Summarization**
- Generates summaries tailored to the user’s needs (e.g., clinical focus, research highlights).
- Includes abstracts, highlights of key findings, and insights into the paper's methodologies and implications.
- Supports customizable summary lengths and formats.

### 5. **Cross-Paper Analysis**
- Compares key findings and relationships across multiple uploaded papers.
- Highlights contradictions, consistencies, or complementary data points between studies.
- Generates aggregated graphs showing the combined relationships between entities across sources.

### 6. **Interactive User Interface**
- User-friendly interface designed for medical professionals with intuitive navigation and tools.
- Includes tabs for summary, graph, dictionary, Q&A, and full-text viewing.
- Allows seamless switching between detailed analysis and high-level summaries.

### 7. **Customizable Settings**
- Supports domain-specific configurations for different fields (e.g., oncology, cardiology, genomics).
- Users can define their own priorities, such as focusing on specific entities or methodologies.
- Offers dark mode and accessibility settings for enhanced user experience.

### 8. **Collaboration and Sharing**
- Enables saving and exporting graph visualizations and summaries for presentations or collaborative discussions.
- Supports annotations and highlights that can be shared with colleagues.
- Integrates with platforms like Google Drive, Dropbox, and email for easy file sharing.

### 9. **Real-Time Updates and Alerts**
- Sends notifications when new relevant papers are published in the user’s field of interest.
- Suggests related research papers based on the content analyzed.
