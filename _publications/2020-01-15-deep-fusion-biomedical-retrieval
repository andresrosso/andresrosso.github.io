excerpt: "Proposes a novel deep fusion framework that integrates multiple term-similarity measures to significantly enhance biomedical passage retrieval. This method employs advanced neural architectures to fuse lexical, semantic, and contextual similarity metrics, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of biomedical text relevance. The approach demonstrates superior performance on challenging datasets by addressing complex term variations and improving retrieval precision in domain-specific queries."
