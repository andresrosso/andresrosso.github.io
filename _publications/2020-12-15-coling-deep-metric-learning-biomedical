excerpt: "Presents a groundbreaking deep metric learning framework that transforms biomedical passage retrieval by embedding questions and passages into a shared semantic space. The approach leverages neural architectures to enhance the alignment of question and passage representations, enabling precise semantic comparisons. Demonstrated superior performance in the BioASQ challenge, significantly outperforming traditional retrieval methods and setting a new benchmark for biomedical information retrieval tasks."
